<p>Enter any two metal bands that were listed on <a href="https://www.metal-archives.com/">Metal Archives</a> as of 03/01/2024 to find the number of degrees of separation in between them.</p>
<p>Please note that there are a few caveats.</p>
<ol>
    <li>All band names must be typed exactly how they are shown on Metal Archives. For instance, if one of the bands you're using is Mot√∂rhead, you would need to include the umlaut.</li>
    <li>Some bands that, depending on your definition of metal, you might consider to be metal are not listed on Metal Archives. Led Zeppelin, for instance, is not present in the database. I do not control which bands are present on Metal Archives, so I don't have any control of what bands are in my database.</li>
    <li>The script I'm using, such as it is, only creates a link between two bands if a musician has been in both. This includes live performances. It <i>does not</i> include guest appearances on albums. I'll work on fixing this issue at some point.</li>
    <li>The presence of a band or artist in this list does not represent my endorsement of their beliefs, actions, or music. This website solely exists as an informative tool/source of trivia.</li>
